## SH Hook Debug
This plug-in adds a search bar to the admin bar for  admins that allows them to search for hooks that have fired on that page load. Selecting a hook displays all the callbacks for that hook.

If the same hook is called multiple times on a page load, the callbacks hooked onto each instance of the hook are listed in turn.
